# Attempt-Two
## creating a website
We all have that one dream(or those few dreams for big dreamers) to create a website. Well, suddenly, today, I had the urge to create a github account. why? I don't know. Then, I thought, if I have already created an account, why not try to make stuff on it! And, I did! May I remind you that I am doing this on mobile, which, from what I've heard, is very difficult.
